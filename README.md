# Elepy Example: Avision

## Project Description
The fictional company, Avision, needs a backend for their completely revamped website. The problem with common CMS solutions is that it is hard to customize the functionality and define how the content of the CMS looks. Another issue is that the company wants to let this brand new backend work with their existing infrastructure. It is also notable that their infrastructure is for the most part written in JVM languages.

The backend must support their new 'Urgent Message Center' microservice. This is a brand-new system that notifies the in-house support team of urgent messages real-time. 'Avision' has provided an \*external library with the interface 'UrgentMessageCenter'.

_\* Let's use our imagination guys. I made this interface and will use a mock implementation._

The backend must include:
- Main Content Creation
- Event Management
- Message Center
- Blog Articles

### Other Requirements
- Support for a web, mobile and desktop frontend


## Notes
